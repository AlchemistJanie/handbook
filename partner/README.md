## Discovery

Once a company/project is discovered that could potentially lead to a nice partnership, we need to setup a discovery call with them in order to have a better understanding of their product, and to help them understand MESG better.

The goal of this meeting is to spot opportunities for collaboration and try to narrow down the details of a future partnership.

## Agreement

Once the discovery call is complete, we should have enough material to create a brief of this partnership with the following points:

#### For CompanyX
- How CompanyX will use MESG
- What are the incentives for CompanyX to use MESG
- How MESG can help CompanyX

#### For MESG
- How MESG can use CompanyX
- What are the benefits of MESG to use CompanyX
- How CompanyX can help MESG

If there is a clear answer to these questions, and both parties are in agreement, we need to have a [Partner Agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FNo_7i12GBhBqJIwNGmIUDFT2OzDFvWC) signed. You can use services like [Hello Sign](https://www.hellosign.com/) to request a signature.

## Materials

Once the agreement is signed, the new partner needs to be onboarded.
- Go to [the partner directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1srTbcchL_gPiGknrtWGqNVhptF-mBnu3)
- Add a new directory with the name of the partner with this format `MESG <> CompanyX`
- Copy the partner agreements into the directory (along with all shared documents like NDA or similar)
- Share this directory with the partner contact
- Now both parties can access each other's resources in this directory
- Copy the [Partner Documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F3feoNVT5tgSIr-mnVtaby9PJxgUoWOu) in this directory to provide details about MESG to this new partner
